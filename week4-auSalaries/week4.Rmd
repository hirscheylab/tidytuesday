This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) challenge: a  weekly social data project (in R), which builds off #makeovermonday style projects but aimed at the R ecosystem. An emphasis will be placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem.

This code is for Week 4, and my effort to reanalyze [these data]
